# Pixel Paladin

## Introduction

This is a sideproject I've been working on and off with. It's a 2D video game that is currently in development. The theme of the game is an action adventure featuring a small paladin character I created. 

## Current Development

At the moment, I am working on creating the art assets using the Aesprite program. Drawing Pixel art characters and background elements, as well as animated said characters.
